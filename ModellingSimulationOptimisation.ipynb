This method would help to decide the optimal number of signalling blocks between stations in London Old Oak and Birmingham Interchange. This simulation will also help the throughput of trains/hr as well as max the throughput of the passenger on every train."

    "1. No delay due to weather and wind conditions, i.e. the normal weather is assumed.<br/> \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Two types of signalling blocks are considered. The first signalling block is the one which has known travelling times (train is expected to be idle) and the other signalling block is the one with known distance (train will achieve max speed).<br/>  London Euston to London Old Oak and Birmingham Interchange to Birmingham Curzon Street has first type of signalling blocks. This information is mentioned in the topic so, no adjustments are made. The second kind of signalling blocks is located within the known distance of 145kms between London Old Oak and Birmingham Interchange stations. The number of blocks between these stations are unknown and are not mentioned in the question. Hence, the effort is made to find the optimum number of blocks between London Old Oak and Birmingham Interchange.<br/> \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The following hypothesis is that the train will start acceleration from first signalling block, i.e. when leaving from London Old Oak and will decelerate at the end of the end signalling block i.e. when reaching the Birmingham Interchange.<br/> \n",
    "4. Final Assumption would be to find the passenger movement time at the station. 1 minute is the time which is assumed. \n"

    "In this project, successful simulation of the trains is created between London and Birmingham station taking care of all the assumptions. Trains schedule were created using simulation. Signalling block between London Old Oak station and Birmingham Interchange is used to build the simulation.\n",
    "As per our assumptions, by running multipule simulation by considering trains, signalling block and wait time it is observed that a train is taking 44-50 minutes to complete the journey from London to Birmingham."
